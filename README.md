<blockquote> <h3> Project Title </h3> </blockquote>
<h1> Data Analysis & Visualization of Loan Datasets: Exploring Meaningful Insights </h1>

<h4>Datasets:</h4>

1. __Portfolio_data.csv :__ Contains details on loans given to customers and their demographic information.
2. __CommunicationHistory.csv :__ Contains information on attempts made to reach out to these customers and the status of these calls.


<h4>Summary:</h4>
This portfolio project aims to analyze and visualize loan datasets to gain meaningful insights into the distribution and patterns of loans given to customers across different states and amounts. The project focuses on exploring the demographic information of customers, the attempts made to reach out to them, and the status of these calls.

The following points were investigated:
1. Distribution of loans across different states
2. Distribution of loans across different amounts
3. Distribution of customers by age
4. Distribution of loans by due dates
5. Unique number of customers contacted every day - only completed calls are to be considered - How many unique borrowers did we contact on day 1, day 2 etc.
6. Number of customers not contacted on every day. How many borrowers are not contacted on day 1, day 2 etc.
7. Who are the customers who have been contacted the most
8. Who are the customers who have been contacted the least
9. How many customers have never been reached out?
10. Distribution of calls by states.
11. Distribution of calls by campaign ids
12. Unique number of customers by campaign ID

<h4>Methodology:</h4>

This portfolio project will use data analysis and visualization techniques to explore the datasets and uncover insights related to the distribution of loans, borrowers, and communication history. The analysis will include cleaning, transforming, and aggregating the data, followed by creating visualizations such as bar charts, to present the findings. The project also demonstrates the use of Python programming language and its data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

<h4>Expected Outcomes:</h4>

Through this project, we expect to gain insights into the loan datasets that can help in making informed decisions related to loan disbursement, borrower outreach, and campaign management.
